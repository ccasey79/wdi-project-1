TV Trivia Game - Project 1
---------------------------

Ideas
-----

My original ideas started with an audio trivia game. I liked the concept of matching an audio soundtrack with some multiple choice answers.

First idea was using recognisable celebrity voiceovers as the audio soundtrack. Then possibly using sound effect audios which players could recognise. Accessing and finding the necessary audio files online would unfortuately limit the options of the type of audio trivia game it could be.

TV Trivia Idea
---------------

The idea I chose to pursue is a game to test your TV trivia. The player has to match the TV theme tune to one of the three multiple choices provided. The TV choices are from any genre and any decade. There are eight questions altogether and five seconds each to choose the answer. When the player completes the eight questions they are given a score. Each question carries ten marks.

Planning
---------

- Preparation started with creating wireframes of how the game could look. 

- How the three multiple choice answers could be arranged. 

- Displaying how the players answers could be right or wrong and also considering the audio sound effects. 

- Quite a bit of preparation had to be done for finding the tv theme audio tracks. Then also gathering the tv poster images of each individual tv show. 

- The game would be created with HTML, design in CSS and functionality with JavaScript.


Brief timeline build of game
--------------------------------

- Wireframes created for ideas of look and functionality of the game.

- TV theme audio files downloaded and tv poster pictures collected and resized.

- Build of the game started with JavaScript, using sudo code to understand how the game would be played and it's logic.

-  Representing the three multiple choice answers were the first parts to be created with JavaScript. Using HTML and CSS to position where the three answers would be displayed.

- Editing the tv theme audio files to eight seconds each and then implementing them into the game.

- Adding the correct and wrong images into the game with JavaScript, they appear according to each questions answer and replace the tv shows image.

- Adding a correct and wrong audio file according to the players answer choice.

- CSS was now being implemented as the functionality of the game was almost completed. Adding a background image and tv image to give an overall design of the game.

- Finally checks were made for correct audio files being played, correct audio durations, questions rotating when answered. Game was then deployed on Heroku.

Overall views
--------------

- I think the game works well as a TV trivia game. If I was to add to this game my intensions were to create a level two. My idea is to guess the correct film from the three multiple choices according to a famous quote from a tv show. Again the player would have approximately eight seconds to answer the question.

- You could add a number of levels to this game as long as it involves using audio files from tv shows. I think as levels get added the level of difficulty would increase.

- Using the amount of data - audio & image files

- Gives a good indication of how a trivia game works on a basic structure.

- First time where I had implemented JavaScript on a project
